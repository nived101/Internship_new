        institute provides scope to our upcoming graduates to get exposure to team work on experimental projects,
        presentations and communication skills and active participations in all extracurricular activities. Since
        necessity is the mother of inventions, our students have participated in every corner of need and took the chaos
        of early years as an opportunity to grow with self determination and innovation. To mention, the institute website
        and many laboratory experiments were designed and fabricated by them. The institution is at a constant attempt of
        making endeavours to scale new heights by developing a synergy between studies, research, and consulting/training
        activities</p>
